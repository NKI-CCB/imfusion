Building a reference
--------------------

Before detecting insertion sites, IM-Fusion first needs to build an
augmented version of the host reference genome that contains the
sequence of the transposon as additional sequence. This augmented reference
is created using the ``imfusion-build`` command, which essentially concatenates
the host reference genome and the transposon sequence (both in Fasta
format) into a new Fasta file and builds the indices needed for alignment.
Separate sub-commands are provided for each supported aligner (currently STAR
and Tophat-Fusion).

The basic command for building a (STAR-based) reference is as follows:

.. code:: bash

    imfusion-build star \
        --reference_seq Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa \
        --reference_gtf Mus_musculus.GRCm38.76.gtf \
        --transposon_seq t2onc2.sequence.fa \
        --transposon_features t2onc2.features.txt \
        --output_dir references/GRCm38.76.t2onc.star \
        --blacklist_genes ENSMUSG00000039095 ENSMUSG00000038402 \
        --star_threads 4

Here, the ``--reference_seq`` argument points to the fasta file containing
the sequence of the reference genome, ``--reference_gtf`` points to the gtf
file containing the reference gene features, ``--transposon_seq`` points to
the transposon sequence and ``--transposon_features`` points to a file
describing the transposon features. The reference files are written to the
path specified by ``--output_dir``.

It is important to blacklist genes or genomic sequences that are part of the
transposon sequence using the optional ``--blacklist_genes`` and
``--blacklist_regions`` arguments. The former can be used to blacklist entire
genes (specified by their ID in the GTF file), whilst the latter can be used
to blacklist specific regions (specified as chr:start-end). Sequences of
blacklisted regions are replaced by 'N' nucleotides in the generated reference.

**Failure to blacklist shared sequences will result in multiple alignments and
prevent proper identification of transposon insertions.**

The command for building a Tophat-Fusion reference is nearly identical:

.. code:: bash

    imfusion-build tophat \
        --reference_seq Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa \
        --reference_gtf Mus_musculus.GRCm38.76.gtf \
        --transposon_seq transposon.fa \
        --transposon_features transposon.features.txt \
        --output_dir references/GRCm38.76.t2onc.tophat \
        --blacklist_genes ENSMUSG00000039095 ENSMUSG00000038402 \

However, both aligners do have some aligner-specific arguments for building
their references. See the help of the respective sub-commands for more details.
For STAR, special attention should be paid to memory usage, as STAR requires
approximately 30GB of memory for building the reference genome.

Detecting insertions (per sample)
---------------------------------

After building the augmented reference, we can detect transposon insertions
in each sample using the ``imfusion-insertions`` command. This command
essentially runs a gene-fusion aware aligner (either STAR or Tophat-Fusion,
with seperate sub-commands for each aligner) to align the RNA-seq reads and
identify gene fusions, extracts gene-transposon fusions from the results and
derives the corresponding insertion sites. The insertions are written as the
tab-separated file ``insertions.txt`` in the output directory.

The basic command for ``imfusion-insertions`` using the STAR aligner is:

.. code:: bash

    imfusion-insertions star
        --fastq sample_s1.R1.fastq.gz \
        --reference references/GRCm38.76.t2onc.star \
        --output_dir output/sample_s1

In this command, the ``--fastq`` argument specifies a path to the fastq
file containing RNA-seq reads for the given sample. For paired-end samples, the
second pair should be provided using the optional ``--fastq2`` argument.
The ``--reference`` argument should point to the previously built augmented
reference, whilst the ``--output_dir`` argument specifies where the
sample output should be written.

An optional ``--assemble`` argument indicates whether IM-Fusion should perform
a reference-guided transcript assembly. If given, IM-Fusion runs Stringtie
after the RNA-seq alignment to detect novel gene transcripts based on the
RNA-seq alignment. The results of this assembly are subsequently used in the
insertion detection step to annotate insertions that involve novel transcripts.

The command for using Tophat-Fusion is nearly identical:

.. code:: bash

    imfusion-insertions tophat
        --fastq sample_s1.R1.fastq.gz \
        --reference references/GRCm38.76.t2onc.tophat \
        --output_dir output/sample_s1

However, both aligners do have some aligner-specific arguments concerning the
alignment. See the help of the respective sub-commands for more details. For
STAR, special attention should be paid to memory usage, as STAR requires
approximately 30GB of memory (per process) for loading the reference genome.

Quantifying expression (per sample)
-----------------------------------

After detecting insertions, we use the generated RNA-seq alignment to quantify
exon expression counts for the given sample. These counts are later used to
test for differential expression when identifying candidate genes from a group
of samples.

The expression counts are generated using the ``imfusion-expression`` command:

.. code:: bash

    imfusion-expression \
        --sample_dir output/sample_s1 \
        --reference references/GRCm38.76.t2onc.star

Here, the ``--sample_dir`` argument should point to a sample directory (which
was previously generated by ``imfusion-insertions``). The ``--reference``
argument should point to the reference that was used to identify insertions.
Two optional arguments ``--paired`` and ``--stranded`` can be used to indicate
whether the alignment contains paired-end sequencing data and to indicate the
strandedness of the RNA-seq reads.

The generated counts are written to the sample directory as the TSV
file ``exon_counts.txt``.

Merging sample results
----------------------

To detect genes that are recurrently mutated across samples, we first merge
the individual sample results into a combined dataset using ``imfusion-merge``.
This command effectively concatenates the individual results into combined
``insertions.txt`` and ``exon_counts.txt`` files.

The basic command is as follows:

.. code:: bash

    imfusion-merge --sample_dirs ./output/sample_s1 \
                                 ./output/sample_s2 \
                   --output ./output/merged.insertions.txt \
                   --output_expression ./output/merged.exon_counts.txt

In this command, the ``--sample_dirs`` argument points to the sample
directories that should be merged and ``output`` indicates that path to
which the merged insertion file should be written. The ``--output_expression``
argument indicates where merged expression counts should be written. This
argument may be omitted if no expression counts were generated for the samples.

Selecting (DE) CTGs
-------------------

To identify genes that are commonly targeted by insertions (commonly targeted
genes, or CTGs), IM-Fusion uses the Poisson distribution to test whether a
given gene has more insertions than may be expected by chance. This test is
performed on the merged dataset using the ``imfusion-ctg`` command:

.. code:: bash

    imfusion-ctg --insertions ./output/merged.insertions.txt  \
                 --expression ./output/merged.exon_counts.txt \
                 --reference references/GRCm38.76.t2onc.star \
                 --chromosomes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \
                               13 14 15 16 17 18 19 X \
                 --output ./output/merged.ctgs.txt

Here, ``--insertions`` and ``--expression`` should point to the merged
insertions and expression files generated by ``imfusion-merge``. The
``--reference`` argument refers to the same reference as used for the
alignment, whilst ``--output`` specifies the path where the CTG output should
be written. The ``--chromosomes`` argument specifies which chromosomes
should be included in the test and is mainly used to omit chromosomes
containing the transposon donor loci.

The parameters for the CTG test can be changed using the ``--window``,
``--pattern`` and ``--chromosomes`` arguments. The ``--window`` parameter
specifies the size of the window around genes within which insertions should
be included. The ``--pattern`` argument can be used to account for integration
biases of the transposon, if the transposon is known to integrate at specific
nucleotide sequences.

Finally, the significance thresholds for the CTG and DE tests can be specified
using the ``--threshold`` and ``--de_threshold`` arguments:

.. code:: bash

    imfusion-ctg --insertions ./output/merged.insertions.txt  \
                 --expression ./output/merged.exon_counts.txt \
                 --reference references/GRCm38.76.t2onc.star \
                 --chromosomes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \
                               13 14 15 16 17 18 19 X \
                 --output ./output/merged.ctgs.txt \
                 --threshold 0.05 \
                 --de_threshold 0.05

Optionally, the differential expression test can be skipped by not providing
the expression data. In this case, only the CTG test is performed:

.. code:: bash

    imfusion-ctg --insertions ./merged.insertions.txt  \
                 --reference references/GRCm38.76.t2onc.star \
                 --chromosomes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \
                               13 14 15 16 17 18 19 X \
                 --output ./output/merged.ctgs.txt
                 --threshold 0.05 \
