0.3.1 (2017-05-09)
------------------

* Several small fixes for Python 2.7 compatibility.
* Fixed issue in CTG test that occurs when no insertions are within the
  gene windows.
* Replaced usage of deprecated .ix indexer for pandas DataFrames.
* Updated documentation.

0.3.0 (2017-05-04)
------------------

* Refactored external tools into the ``imfusion.external`` module.
* Use docker/tox for testing against multiple Python versions locally.
* Added additional checks for inputs and improved error messages.
* Added support for DataFrame insertion inputs to DE testing functions.
* Added building of exon gtf as part of imfusion-build.
* Added identification of endogenous fusions using STAR-Fusion as part
  of imfusion-insertions (using STAR). Also adds script for building
  (murine) STAR-Fusion references.

  headless servers/HPCs.
